        Premed Compass grew out of my own scramble to figure out which schools were realistic targets. Every site
        I found either focused on rankings or forced me to bounce between tabs to check stats. This project is my
        attempt to pull everything into one dashboard that&apos;s easier to digest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming up: a card-based catalog for each school, a comparison view for favorites, and a cleaner way to
        surface residency match info. I want the interface to stay simple, accessible, and fast, so the styling
        will lean on Bootstrap as a foundation with custom tweaks layered in later.
